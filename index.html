                <p>From Wikipedia:
                    <br><br>
                    The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially "the Met",[a] is the largest art museum in the
                    Western Hemisphere. Its permanent collection contains over two million works,[1] divided among 17 curatorial
                    departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park
                    on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by area one of the world's largest art museums. A much smaller second
                    location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art,
                    architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.
